# ~dig~

Note: we're currently in the process of re-naming and re-launching what used to be called dig.  For historical purposes, we will continue to use this commit history, but the repository will be wiped out. 

It will come back as an application platform, that strictly follows the most generic ways of allowing contract authors to use CosmWasm.
