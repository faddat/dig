# ~dig~


Note: we're currently in the process of re-naming and re-launching Dig.

Dig is a hub blockchain that interconnects physical plots of land, which will each be governed by a locally operated blockchain.  Due to the regulatory challenges involved, dig splits itself up into many chains which can each follow appropriate legislation.  This is the beginning of the "Dig Network."

[**Creating a validator**](https://github.com/notional-labs/dig/blob/master/dig_validator.md)

## Design
**form**
* Software-wise, dig is a monorepo.  All of its essential code lives in this repository:
  * Genesis
  * Javascript Front End Code
  * Mobile App
  * Block explorer

**function**
* The dig mainnet is as minimal as possible.  While we may add a few things before mainnet, it's our preference to remove things.  The dig mainnet is for coordinating the efforts of like-minded people who'd like to see:
  * Liquid Land: Blockchain style real estate investing
  * Charter Cities: Land where the rules are laid out on the chain that constitutes them
  * Hierarchical transparent governance: The trouble with hierarchical orgs is opacity, not hierarchy itself.
  * Research and development of blockchain governance in physical and virtual spaces.    


* Chains in the dig network will launch from the code in this repository, as well.   


## Financing
We're comitted to transparency in all matters, including the composition of genesis allocations.  Adam has raised funds for Dig's development work.  Pre-launch we'll post the final tally.  We will only accept funding from parties who are aligned with the long-term vision of the project. Investors in the project will have their coins unvested, while DFY airdrop participants will be vested over a 24 month period. 


## Confirmed-ish SoonTM Digs
These will launch rapidly after Dig.  Their paths will converge and diverge.  All of them will heavily leverage IBC, and some may leverage CosmWasm.

## Roadmap

- [x] Concept development by Jacob Gadikian and Adam Christopher Chaplin
- [x] Prototype
- [x] Airdrop Prototype code and OpenAPI spec
- [x] Testnet-1:  Results showed that we needed to work on the genesis parameters in Testnet-2
- [x] Omniflix Testnet-1: Participating in the OmniFlix testnet proved the viablity of a large validator set.  Testnet-2 allows 500 validators.
- [x] Upgrade to Cosmos SDK 0.43.0
- [x] IBC Testing
- [x] NFT Implementation by Khanh Nguyen (not included in testnet-2)
- [x] Genesis transactions for testnet-2: Completed August 14, 2021
- [x] Keplr integration
- [x] Akash-based Bus bar
- [x] Launch testnet-2
- [x] IPFS-based genesis hosting and download
- [x] Configuration overrides
- [x] Clean airdrop code https://github.com/notional-labs/c17 and https://github.com/notional-labs/staking-data-collection
  - [x] Test airdrop code for ethereum-style addresses using the Khanh's Cosmos SDK fork
  - [x] Refactor airdrop if this works
- [x] Community Security Audit: 0.1% of Dig tokens reserved for community members who provide a detailed, contextual audit (seems no one voluneered, and we've audited, but no one will be recieving this bounty. 
- [x] Block explorers
  - [x] gex
  - [x] big dipper 1.0
  - [x] ping.pub
  - [x] chill validation

- [x] 2nd genesis audit
- [x] Mainnet Launch
- [x] Chain Registry
- [x] IBC Integration
  - [x] Osmosis 
  - [x] Juno
  - [ ] Emeris
